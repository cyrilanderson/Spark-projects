In this assignment, analyzed a dataset from Kaggle :

The data, from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, is documented here:
https://www.kaggle.com/bls/american-time-use-survey

The datasets contain information about how people spend their time (e.g., sleeping, eating, working, etc.).

For this assignment, we used in particular the Activity Summary File dataset atussum.csv

To try this yourself, you will need to download the CSV dataset and place it in the project folder in:
src/main/resources/timeusage/

This assignment focussed on working with Apache Spark Dataset and DataFrame structures.
High level summary / grouping calculations were performed on the data using both DataFrame and Dataset approaches.
In addition, we compared carrying out part of the same calculations using a Spark SQL query.

The Spark Scala API was used for this assignment, carried out in a Spark course in part of a Scala Coursera specialization.
